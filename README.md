# FranklinFAQ

Trying to have demos for things people ask about.

You can look at [the page](https://tlienart.github.io/FranklinFAQ/) with the questions and answers or at its source here (the page also makes reference to elements of the source).

Please help by donating small demos of "how to do X" which we can point people to later. Thanks!
